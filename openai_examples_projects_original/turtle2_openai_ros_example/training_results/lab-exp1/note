NOTE

- experiment: lab-exp1

    alpha: 0.1
    gamma: 0.7
    epsilon: 0.9
    epsilon_discount: 0.999 
    nepisodes: 6000 
    nsteps: 10000

    new_ranges: 5
    min_range: 0.5
    max_laser_value: 6
    min_laser_value: 0
 
    end_episode_points: 0

- number of action: 3 (forward, left, right)

- observation: leader_pose_x

- leader's goal (3.0, 0.0)

- the leader doesn't wait at the end

- modify epsilon-greedy algorithm: the random part is purely random [not the one that adding noise to q(s,a)]

- distance-based reward function (r = -1 * distance_to_desired_pose), no end of episode reward/penalty
